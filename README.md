Advent of Code in Go

I want to get better at golang and I think advent of code gives me a nice plattform to improve on my abilities

## DEVELOP BRANCH
This is for my personal testing of implementing a proper program with testing suite and so on

Looking into auto loading puzzles or at least a different solution than the switch case I use right now

## Goals
 - [ ] way to start the program to setup a new day
   - [ ] create skeleton go files
   - [ ] create empty input file
   - [ ] create empty test file
   - [ ] configurable to have more than one test file
   - [ ] automatic download of the input
 - [ ] split up Part one and Part two in seperat files
 - [ ] Unittesting
 - [ ] make file to build executable
 - [ ] more to come...?
